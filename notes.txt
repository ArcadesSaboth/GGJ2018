Round:
Lasts for 30 secs

The board spawns at least 10 elements in a random position
	Each element must not overlap

When the user types each element fill it's text this way:
	Green - if an element with the same name exists already on the board
	Red - if it's the only element in the board
	
Review: the board can't have more than 2 of the same word.

Each element stays on the screen for a number of seconds of 2 * length of the word, then fades
When an element fades, it is substituted by another one.


Iteration 1:
Have 10 elements to spawn at random, with a time limit each. When the timer expires, they are substituted.


1) You type, cards get updated and raise their match value from 0 to their length															V
2) If a card expires and has more than zero level, it resets the input																		V
3) If two or cards have a match, they became green																							V
4) If there is only one card, it is red																										V
5) When the user press ENTERS and there is at least one match, he gets a point for each match. Each non matching card is just discarded.	X
6) When the input is reset, for each non-matching card, the user loses points																X
7) Create a Round sequence.
8) They must not overlap!
