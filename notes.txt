Round:
Lasts for 30 secs

The board spawns at least 10 elements in a random position
	Each element must not overlap

When the user types each element fill it's text this way:
	Green - if an element with the same name exists already on the board
	Red - if it's the only element in the board
	
Review: the board can't have more than 2 of the same word.

Each element stays on the screen for a number of seconds of 2 * length of the word, then fades
When an element fades, it is substituted by another one.


Iteration 1:
Have 10 elements to spawn at random, with a time limit each. When the timer expires, they are substituted.
